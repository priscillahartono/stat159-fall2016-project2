For this project, the data set we will use is _**Credit.csv**_ , which can be downloaded from the author of _**An Introduction to Statistical Learning**_'s website `http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Credit.csv`. The _**Credit**_ data set records _**balance**_ as the response variable with several quantitative and qualitative variables as the predictors.  
  
The _**balance**_ response variable records the average credit card debt for _**400**_ individuals according to the quantitative and qualitative predictors.
  
The qualitative variables are:  

* _**gender**_  (F/M)
* _**student**_ (status: yes/no) 
* _**married**_  (status: yes/no)
* _**ethnicity**_  (caucasian, african american, asian)


The quantitative variables are:  

* _**age**_  
* _**cards**_ (number of credit cards)  
* _**education**_  (years of education)
* _**income**_  (in thousands of dollars)
* _**limit**_  (credit limit)
* _**rating**_ (credit rating)
